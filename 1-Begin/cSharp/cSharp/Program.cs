    #region DataType and Questions

    //DataTypes
    //int, float, double, string, bool,

    //What is a Datatype? - A datatype specifies what type of Value in variable can contain.

    //Which one of the following Datatypes is not considered as "primitive"? - STRING
    //Correct. String is a Class and not a primitive Datatype.It's still a Datatype, thou. It's basically containing multiple Characters.


    //Const are immutable values which are know at compile time and do not change for the life of the program. [Usually Fields]

    //If you want to convert a number into a string. What Kind of conversion is necessary? (Type-Conversion)


    ///////////////////////////////////Sample Code
    //double myDouble = 13.37;
    //int myInt;
    //myInt = (int) myDouble;
    //Console.WriteLine(myInt);

    //Parsing string to int
    //string myString = "15";
    //int myInt = Int32.Parse(myString);
    //Console.WriteLine(myInt);


    //Const are fields
    //const int number = 9;

    #region Methods And Try/Catch -- Unary-Operator

    //try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated.It is followed by one or more catch blocks.
    //catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem.The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
    //finally − The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown.For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.

    //Unary-Operators do? - Modify the Value of the related Variable
    //What is the Return-Type when using Equality-Operators or Conditional Operators? BOOLEAN
